# QuartoProject
Quarto is a Spanish word which stands for Room. This project was built in college as a problem based on real-life example, where students who came from fairly long distance to college find difficult to get a room alternate to college hostel as an accommodation. Hence I developed an android application that has a collection of room available nearby college, This application uses Firebase for authentication of the users through OTP on there mobile number Once user logged can find nearby room according to there preference.

This is was an attempt to solved the real-life problem faced by the students in my college.
