# QuartoProject
Quarto is a Spanish word which stands for Room.
This project was build in my third year as a problem based on real life example, 
where students who came from fairly long distance to college find difficult to get a room alternate to college hostel as a accomadation.
Hence i developed an android application which has collection of room available near by college, This application uses Firebase for authentication of the users through OTP on there mobile number
Once user logged, can find near by room according to there preference.

This is was an attempt to solved the real life problem faced by the students in my college.
